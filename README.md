# wow-ui-details-prio-damage
Plugin for WoW addon Details! to count damage done to priority targets

Two components:
1. Script. Import it by copy-pasting the string into Scripts -> Import
2. Auto run code. This is just to initialize which mobs to count as "priority targets." Copy paste the code into the Auto Run code panel (don't overwrite other auto run code you might have).
